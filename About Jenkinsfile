A Jenkinsfile is a text file that forms the backbone of defining and managing a Jenkins Pipeline.
It acts as a script, written in Groovy DSL (Domain Specific Language), that tells Jenkins what steps to take when automating your software delivery process.
It is a combination of plugins that support the integration and implementation of continuous delivery pipelines using Jenkins.
a Jenkins Pipeline is a collection of jobs or events that brings the software from version control into the hands of the end users by using automation tools. 
It is used to incorporate continuous delivery in our software development workflow.

Example of a simple Jenkinsfile:

Groovy:

pipeline {

  agent any

  stages {

    stage('Build') {

      steps {

        echo 'Building the application...'

        sh 'mvn package'

      }

    }

    stage('Test') {

      steps {

        echo 'Running unit tests...'

        sh 'mvn test'

      }

    }

    stage('Deploy') {

      steps {

        echo 'Deploying to production...'

        sh 'scp target/my-app.war my-server:/var/www/'

      }

    }

  }

}

Understanding Jenkins..

A Jenkins job is a sequential set of tasks that a user defines. For example, a job can fetch source code from version control, compile the code, run unit tests, and more.

Jenkins Jobs are a given set of tasks that runs sequentially as defined by the user. Any automation implemented in Jenkins is a Jenkins Job. 
These jobs are a significant part of Jenkins's build process. We can create and build Jenkins jobs to test our application or project. 

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps developers automate various tasks related to building, testing, and deploying software applications. 
It is one of the most popular continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools available today, used by many companies and organizations to streamline their software development processes.

Jenkins allows developers to create pipelines that automate the entire software development process, from code check-in to testing, building, and deployment.
It integrates with various tools and technologies used in the software development life cycle, such as Git, Maven, Docker, and Kubernetes, among others.

Jenkins is highly customizable and extensible, with a vast array of plugins available to enhance its functionality and adapt it to specific needs.
It also has a large and active community of users and contributors, who continuously improve and maintain the software.
