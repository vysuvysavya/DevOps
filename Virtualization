Virtualization is a strategy for separating a service from its underlying physical delivery mechanism. 
It is the process of constructing a virtual representation of anything, such as computer hardware. 
It was first created during the mainframe era. It entails utilizing specialized software to generate a virtual or software-created representation of a computer resource rather than the actual resource itself.
Virtualization allows different operating systems and applications to operate on the same computer and hardware at the same time, enhancing hardware usage and flexibility. 

In other words, virtualization is one of the most common cost-effective, hardware-reducing, and energy-saving approaches employed by cloud providers.
Virtualization allows several consumers and organizations to share a single physical instance of a resource or application at the same time.
It accomplishes this by giving a logical name to physical storage and delivering a reference to that resource when needed. 
The word "virtualization" is frequently used interchangeably with hardware virtualization, which is critical to successfully offering Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud computing solutions.
Furthermore, virtualization technologies create a virtual environment for programs, storage, memory, and networking.


Virtualization has a significant influence on cloud computing. on the case of cloud computing, users store data on the cloud,
but with the aid of virtualization, they have the added benefit of sharing infrastructure.
Cloud vendors supply the necessary physical resources, but they demand a high cost for these services, which affects every customer or company.
Virtualization assists users or organizations in sustaining those services that a company need through external (third-party) workers, hence lowering the firm's costs.
This is how virtualization works in cloud computing.
